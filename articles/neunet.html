    <h2>Understanding Neural Networks</h2>

    <p>Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns.
        They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling or clustering raw input.
        The patterns they recognize are numerical, contained in vectors, into which all real-world data, be it images,
        sound, text or time series, must be translated.</p>

    <p>Neural networks help us cluster and classify. You can think of them as a clustering and classification layer
        on top of the data you store and manage.
        They help to group unlabeled data according to similarities among the example inputs,
        and they classify data when they have a labeled dataset to train on.</p>

    <br>
    <p>The layers are made of nodes. A node is just a place where computation happens,
        loosely patterned on a neuron in the human brain, which fires when it encounters sufficient stimuli.
        A node combines input from the data with a set of coefficients, or weights, that either amplify or dampen that input,
        thereby assigning significance to inputs with regard to the task the algorithm is trying to learn;
        e.g. which input is most helpful is classifying data without error? These input-weight products are summed and then the sum
        is passed through a node’s so-called activation function, to determine whether and to what extent that signal should progress
        further through the network to affect the ultimate outcome, say, an act of classification. If the signals passes through,
        the neuron has been “activated.”</p>
